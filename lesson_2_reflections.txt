What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
It looks to me that when you initialize a reporsitory, any changes made to its files can be tracked by using git. 
If this is not done then it can't be managed using git, as far as I can see.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area contains informations about files that are intended to be committed to the repository during the
current commit. There may be files in the working directory that are not tracked in the staging area. It allows 
keeping commits more granular then committing everything in the working directory at the same time and also more 
logical because only changes that go together can be chosen to be committed together.
