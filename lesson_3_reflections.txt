When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
I would want to use it to make is easier to share my work with other people.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay 
up-to-date with your remote repository?
It could be to make sure that the local repository only has the changes that are needed in it
at any given time rather than the ones that could cause unforeseen effects.
